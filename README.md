This repository already contains two branches named "main" and "development".
After creating the file necessary to complete your tasks and making changes to it, you need to commit the changes. To do this, enter a short description of the changes and confirm your commit by clicking on "commit changes".
If you have to create a new branch under a different name, then go to the "branches" tab in the repository and create a new branch with the required name.
After that you can merge branches.
To do this, go to the "pull requests" tab and you will see that there will be version differences between the main branch and the branch you have chosen.
Accordingly, in order for you to merge branches, you need to create a new "pull request". Carefully select the branches to merge and commit.
